# Our work with Bildr

[Bildr](https://bildr.com) is a no-code tool that nonetheless aims to give builders full control of their projects via advanced GUIs. Because they don't hide the complexity of coding, it's useful for their audience to understand **coding concepts**, even though they are not coders, and not planning on learning to code.

Ritza produced [Coding concepts for no-code builders: Understanding sizing in CSS](https://ritza.co/showcase/bildr/understanding-sizing-in-css.html) for Bildr.
